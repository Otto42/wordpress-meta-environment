# Troubleshooting and Support

If you run into any problems, the first step is to check out the common problems/solutions below,
and [search for an existing issue](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment/issues). If that
doesn't help, feel free to open a new issue, or ping *iandunn* in the *#meta* channel on
[WordPress' Slack server](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

Before asking for help, please take a log of the provisioning process,

inside vm
> bin/reset
  -- er, don't wanna do that b/c will delete any db changes or patches they're working on
  -- but without it, provision will only show the update process
  maybe ok since reset.sh prompts for confirmation first and warns it'll remove stuff?
outside vm
> vagrant provision 2>&1 | tee wme-provision.log

ugh wish vagrant or vvv just stored log by default. maybe there's something you can do to make that happen?

## Problems with the entire environment

* **Nginx configuration file test failed**: If you see an error like this:

	> ==> default: nginx: [emerg] open() "/srv/www/meta-environment/buddypressorg.dev/logs/nginx-access.log" failed (2: No such file or directory)
	> ==> default: nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed

	...then make sure that you cloned the WME repository into a folder named `wordpress-meta-environment`, rather than just `meta-environment`, or something arbitrary. If the folder is named anything other than `wordpress-meta-environment`, then the provision process will break. See the `Setup` section above for details.

* **Subversion client version conflicts:** Subversion repositories are checked out using version 1.8 inside the
  virtual machine, and the 1.8 repository format is not compatible with the svn 1.7 client. If you have an older
  client and try to run any svn commands, you'll get a *`The client is too old to work with the working copy`*
  error. Unfortunately there is no way to downgrade the repository format, but you can work around the issue by
  either, 1) Upgrading your svn client to version 1.8+; or 2) Work with svn from inside the virtual machine.

* **Windows** installations: Adrian Pop has documented some tips for [installing the Meta Environment on Windows](http://test.informagination.ro/wordpress-meta-environment-in-win-10/).

* **My IDE (or other tool) doesn't recognize `public_html` as a Git checkout:** Because `public_html` is a symlink, you may need to open `vagrant.local/www/wordpress-meta-environment/meta-repository/{site}/public_html` as the project root, instead of `vagrant.local/www/wordpress-meta-environment/{site}/public_html`. Another option is to use Git from the command line. 


## Problems with specific sites

* **Developer.WordPressorg.dev WP-Parser memory errors:** You may need to increase the amount of RAM that the virtual
  machine has in order to run the parser for `developer.wordpress.dev`. To do that, open VVV's `Vagrantfile`,
  locate the line that contains `v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 512]`, and change `512` to `1024`. Once
  you've done that, run `vagrant halt && vagrant up` to make the change take effect.

* **WordPressTV.dev video upload errors:** The WPTV uploader integrates with VideoPress, which requires a connection
  to WordPress.com and a paid VideoPress subscription, so it isn't enabled.
