# Troubleshooting and Support

If you run into any problems, the first step is to check out the common problems/solutions below,
and [search for an existing issue](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment/issues). If that
doesn't help, follow the instructions in the `Support` section at the bottom of this page.


## Problems with the entire environment

### Subversion client version conflicts

Subversion repositories are checked out using version 1.8 inside the virtual machine, and the 1.8 repository format is not compatible with the svn 1.7 client. If you have an older client and try to run any svn commands, you'll get a *`The client is too old to work with the working copy`* error. Unfortunately there is no way to downgrade the repository format, but you can work around the issue by either, 1) Upgrading your svn client to version 1.8+; or 2) Work with svn from inside the virtual machine.

### Windows installations

Adrian Pop has documented some tips for [installing the Meta Environment on Windows](http://test.informagination.ro/wordpress-meta-environment-in-win-10/).

### My IDE (or other tool) doesn't recognize `public_html` as a Git checkout

Because `public_html` is a symlink, you may need to open `vagrant.local/www/wordpress-meta-environment/meta-repository/{site}/public_html` as the project root, instead of `vagrant.local/www/wordpress-meta-environment/{site}/public_html`. Another option is to use Git from the command line.

### Databases not created

If you ran `vagrant destroy` after provisioning, and later re-provisioned, then the symlinks that were created during the first provisioning won't be removed. Those are used to determine whether or not to import the database and install plugins. To fix that, removing the symlinked `public_html` folders, and then run `vagrant provision` again.


## Problems with specific sites

### Developer.WordPressorg.test WP-Parser memory errors

You may need to increase the amount of RAM that the virtual machine has in order to run the parser for `developer.wordpress.test`. To do that, open VVV's `vvv-custom.yml` and look for the `vm_config` section that looks like this:

```yaml
vm_config:
  memory: 2048
  cores: 2
  # provider: vmware_workstation
```

And increase the `2048` value. If this section isn't in your `vvv-custom.yml` file, add it. Then, reprovision for the change to take effect with the `vagrant reload` command.

### WordPressTV.test video upload errors

The WPTV uploader integrates with VideoPress, which requires a connection to WordPress.com and a paid VideoPress subscription, so it isn't enabled.


## Support

If nothing above helped, then feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment/issues/new), or ping `@iandunn` in the `#meta` channel on [WordPress' Slack server](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

Before asking for help, please take a log of the provisioning process, to help us troubleshoot the problem. You can do that by running the commands below:

***Warning:*** These commands will remove any changes you've made inside `public_html` directories, so make sure you back up anything you want to save before you run this.

	cd /path/to/your/vagrant.local/www/wordpress-meta-environment
	vagrant halt
	rm -rf */public_html
	git reset --hard HEAD
	vagrant up --provision 2>&1 | tee wme-provision.log

Then share `wme-provision.log` when asking for help.
