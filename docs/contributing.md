# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Check out [the existing issues](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment/issues)
for things that need some help, or open an issue to suggest something that's not on the list.

Before you make any **database changes** for a pull request, please make sure that you delete your local copy of the
database and import the latest version. That will make merging much easier and helps avoid regressions.
